### Hi there üëã
Hi, I‚Äôm Prachee and I'm a second year studying Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo. I'm a full-stack web developer, UI/UX designer and an ardent, lifelong learner who is always creating and learning awesome stuff. I love solving problems! Whether it's finding the most elegant way to write a line of code or solving riveting sudoku puzzles, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions.
